# 30c3-twitterwall
Very basic twitterwall from https://github.com/fNordeingang/orrjobbot i just
make some cosmetic changes. thanks to nomaster from chaosdorf for some help.

## getting started
start the "server" by using "node server.js [consumer_key] [consumer_secret]
[access_token_key] [access_token_secret] [track]"

You get the keys from Twitter. Create an app on https://dev.twitter.com â€“
the URLs and name don't matter, you won't be using it to authenticate people

All you have to change is the IP of the "server" in my case, it is "localhost".
change it to your needs.
